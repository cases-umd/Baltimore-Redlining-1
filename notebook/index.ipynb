    "> After the [1929 Stock Market Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929), thousands of Americans were in danger of home foreclosure. To address this problem and stabilize the market, The Home Owners Loan Coperation (HOLC) was created under the Rooselvelt Administration to asses credibility of families in order to decide to refinance their homes.\n",
    "The HOLC created area descriptions and maps to \"grade\" neighborhoods based on racial/ethnic presence, the income of the residents, and environmental factors to determine their \"financial risk\". A grade of an 'A' (red) , was given to an area characterized as undesirable due to detrimental influences and unfavorable infiltration. Grade 'B' (yellow) areas were characterized by infiltration of a \"lower grade population\", \"lacking homogeniety\", and age of the neighborhoods, grade 'C' (blue) areas were completely developed, and 'grade 'D' (green) areas were characterized as \"hot spots\" that weren't fully built up yet and contained homogeinety. This is called [__*redlining*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), denying financial services based on race/ethnic background. <img src=\"baltimoremap-min.png\" alt=\"Baltimore security grade map\" title=\"Baltimore Security Grade Map\" align = \"right\" width=600> <br> <br> This module stems from the __Mapping Inequality Project__, a big cultral data project which uses archival practices and digital curation techniques to curate the HOLC collections, extract information from the text, and share the information with the public.\n",
    "This is important because the HOLC records are currently stored at [National Archives, College Park](https://www.archives.gov/college-park) in RG 195: General Records of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and can only be accessed by physically visiting the center and accessing the records. <br> <br> This module is inspired by __Mapping Inequality: Baltimore __, a Maryland Day 2016 presentation which discussed the [history](https://dcicblog.umd.edu/redliningbaltimore/baltimores-history/) of redlining in particulary Baltimore and showcased HOLC Baltimore archival documents and the [interactive Baltimore security grade map](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.2923/-76.6331&opacity=0.8&city=baltimore-md).<img src=\"baltimorehousing_survey.png\" alt=\"Baltimore security grade map\" title=\"Loan Rent Housing Survey\" align=left width=200>"

    "> An analysis by National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) found that in Baltimore [64% of communities identified](http://maps.ncrc.org/holcanalysis/holcpdf/HOLC_Baltimore,%20MD.pdf) as \"Hazardous\" by the HOLC are still majority-minority areas in 2010 Census and 74% of these areas remain low to moderate income. By analyzing the data from historical records we can generate information about the past and understand patterns in the present. <br> <br> In this module, we would like to visualize the characteristics, defined by Home Owners' Loan Coperation, of communities in 1930's Baltimore."
